💧 Smart Water Management System
📌 Overview

The Smart Water Management System is an IoT and web-based solution designed to monitor and manage household water usage in real time. It integrates water flow sensors with a Python backend and a responsive website to help users track their daily consumption, calculate fines for excess usage, and request extra water when required. The project promotes awareness, accountability, and sustainable water use.

🎯 Features

Real-time monitoring of water usage using flow sensors.

Daily consumption limits based on house size and number of residents.

Automatic calculation of fines when usage exceeds the allocated quota.

Interactive website dashboard with storage and usage visualization.

Option for users to request additional water for special occasions.

Data storage and retrieval for usage history and analysis.

🏗️ System Architecture

Sensor Layer (IoT Device)

Water flow sensors connected to ESP32/Arduino measure usage.

Data is sent to the backend via Wi-Fi.

Backend (Python Flask)

Stores usage data in a database.

Provides APIs to log and retrieve data.

Calculates daily usage and fines.

Frontend (Website)

Built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

Displays user details, usage progress, fines, and request options.

Provides a user-friendly and responsive interface.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
